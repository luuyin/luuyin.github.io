Greetings! I'm Lu, an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/). I am honored to be a long-term visitor and collaborator with the [Visual Informatics Group (VITA)](https://vita-group.github.io/) at UT Austin. Additionally, I am a visiting scholar at [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/) and [MPI-ELLIS](https://www.tuebingen.mpg.de/212585/ellis).


Previously, I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow at [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/) and worked as a research scientist intern at Google's New York City office.

I was selected as a [CPAL 2026 Rising Star](https://cpal.cc/). I lead the Lightweight & Universal Machine Intelligence ([LUMI]({{ '/teams/' | relative_url }})) lab. My research interests include:
- Efficient and Scalable Foundation Models
- Understanding and Enhancing LLMs  
- Interdisciplinary AI Applications

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything with me :)
