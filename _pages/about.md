Greetings! I'm Lu, an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/). I am honored to be a long-term visitor and collaborator with the [Visual Informatics Group (VITA)](https://vita-group.github.io/) at UT Austin, led by [Prof. Atlas Wang](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/atlas-wang). Additionally, I am a long-term visiting researcher at [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I lead the Lightweight & Universal Machine Intelligence (LUMI) lab.

Previously, I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow at [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/) and worked as a research scientist intern at Google's New York City office.

My research interests include:
